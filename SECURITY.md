# Security Policy

We take security of our software products and services seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our software products or services, we encourage you to report it to us quickly (even if you're not sure :smile:). We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please report potential vulnerabilities via the `Report a vulnerability` button in the `Security` tab.

## Public Discussions

Please refrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability, as we'd prefer to discuss the issue privately and come up with a solution in order to limit broader impact.
